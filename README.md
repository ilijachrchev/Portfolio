## 💡 Design Philosophy

> “Simplicity isn’t lack of detail — it’s mastery of it.”

This site is built around **intentional design choices**:
clean typography, subtle animation, and one consistent accent (the red dot).
Every interaction is crafted to feel deliberate and balanced.

This isn’t a template — it’s a statement.
Every pixel, gradient, and line of code was crafted to express **who I am and how I build.**
